Medrex system is built completely over Java & J2EE stack. Initially started with Swing based desktop application where we developed swing component library from scratch and persistence using hibernate. Desktop client-server interaction using Java RMI. Later extended it to Http through J2EE server with RMI-Http bridge. Android app used rest service (struts) for interaction.
